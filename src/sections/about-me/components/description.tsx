				From the early stages of my education, recognizing the expanding
				software industry and the increasing demand for software engineers in
				Iran, particularly in web development, I embarked on my career in this
				field. My journey began with an internship at Karin Payesh, where I
				engaged in front-end development using React. This experience marked the
				start of my professional path, which continued with roles at Soroush
				Educational Complex, 3Tex Exchange, and Pazh Tax Company. As a front-end
				developer and software engineer, I gained valuable experience with
				project management tools like Git and Jira, and developed soft skills
				such as problem-solving, teamwork, and time management. These
				experiences culminated in the development of a house rental website,
				HomeLand, as a full-stack developer for my thesis.

				During my final year at university, I discovered a strong interest in
				machine learning. I collaborated on facial detection projects using
				neural networks and CNN, gaining hands-on experience with ML frameworks,
				vision algorithms, and large datasets. I also completed AI courses on
				Coursera to deepen my understanding. I further explored my interest
				through personal projects, including COVID-19 detection, handwriting
				recognition, and real estate pricing prediction, which solidified my
				dedication to advancing my expertise in AI.
